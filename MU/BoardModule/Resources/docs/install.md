# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy MUBoardModule into your `modules` directory. Afterwards you should have a folder named `modules/MU/BoardModule/Resources`.
2. Initialize and activate MUBoardModule in the extensions administration.
3. Move or copy the directory `Resources/userdata/MUBoardModule/` to `/web/uploads/MUBoardModule/`.
   Note this step is optional as the install process can create these folders, too.
4. Make the directory `/web/uploads/MUBoardModule/` writable including all sub folders.
